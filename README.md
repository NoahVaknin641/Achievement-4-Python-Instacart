# Achievement-4-Python-project
***Objective:***
The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Instacart's sales data to uncover insights about customer behaviors and purchasing patterns. These insights will support the marketing and sales teams in designing effective strategies to optimize advertising, product placement, and customer targeting.

Which days of the week have the most orders?
Which hours of the day are the busiest?
Times When Customers Spend the Most Money:

Are there specific times of the day when customers tend to spend more?
How can this information guide product advertising at these times?
Price Range Groupings:

How can products be grouped into simpler price ranges to streamline marketing efforts?
What is the distribution of orders across these price ranges?
Product Popularity:

Which product categories or departments have the highest frequency of orders?
Are certain product types consistently more popular than others?
Customer Behavior and Segmentation:

What is the distribution of customers based on brand loyalty (i.e., return frequency)?
How do ordering habits differ by:
Customer loyalty status
Geographic region
Age, income, and family status
What classifications can be identified from demographic data, such as:
Age groups
Income levels
Family status
Preferences for certain types of goods
How do different customer profiles vary in terms of:
